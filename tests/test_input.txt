1
00:00:01,404 --> 00:00:04,565
Berlin, early July 1945.

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,567
Since the end of the housing war in Hitler's centre of power,

3
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:12,648
the Soviet authorities have determined the future of the city.

4
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:19,411
Two months after the end of the war, the British and Americans are allowed to move into their agreed sectors.

5
00:00:19,892 --> 00:00:28,515
A camera crew of Hollywood director George Stevens ventures into the Soviet-occupied part of the city at the Brandenburg Gate.

6
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:36,505
At Pariser Platz, the men first filmed the badly damaged Hotel Adlon.

7
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:40,747
Before the war, one of the most fashionable abodes in Berlin,

8
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:44,468
it was a military hospital during the battle for the capital.

9
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:51,150
Shortly after the surrender, the building caught fire and has been uninhabitable ever since.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,221
Just around the corner, Unter den Linden,

11
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:01,161
a ruin is collapsing.

12
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:07,444
At the Brandenburg Gate, George Stevens poses in his jeep,

13
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:10,486
just as he's used to doing in the Dream Factory.

14
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:17,869
He would have loved to have been there with his cameras at Hitler's downfall.

15
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:27,694
But Allied reporters are not allowed to enter Berlin until July to document the lives of the defeated after 12 years of Nazi rule and six years of war.

16
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:56,409
Berlin's former boulevard is now passable again.

17
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,890
Bicycles are a luxury as a means of transport.

18
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:07,514
Debris is being removed and tidied up everywhere.

19
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,235
The last weeks of the war,

20
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:12,436
the bombing raids,

21
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:14,957
the excesses of the Soviet conquerors,

22
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:16,638
seem almost forgotten.

23
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:20,579
It's not yet clear how things will continue.

24
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:26,239
In a little over a week, the victorious powers will discuss this in Potsdam.

25
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:33,325
Moscow, the 24th of June 1945. Six weeks after the German surrender,

26
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:37,648
the Soviet Union celebrates its victory over the fascist beast.

27
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:43,953
Here, before the walls of the Holy Kremlin,

28
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,655
the country greets its sons who have returned from victory.

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,503
heroes of unprecedented battles on all fronts of the Patriotic War.

30
00:02:55,225 --> 00:03:02,611
From Lenin's mausoleum, Joseph Stalin receives the homage of his subjects and oversees the Red Army's grand parade in Red Square.

31
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:12,420
For four years, the generalissimo demanded everything of his people to drive the German invaders out of the country.

32
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,209
The Soviet Union suffered 27 million casualties in the Great patriotic war.

33
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:23,509
The Red Army celebrates itself and its victory over Hitler.

34
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,316
The symbols of Nazi rule are thrown on the ground in front of the Red Dictator in camera-ready fashion.

35
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,938
Stalin is at the height of his power.

36
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:34,680
With the help of the Red Army,

37
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,783
he will consolidate the Soviet Union's status as a superpower.

38
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:58,965
July 1945, a flight over a desert of rubble. 50,000 tons of explosives fell on Berlin during the war.

39
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:03,768
Of the buildings in the German capital, 48,000 are destroyed,

40
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:10,211
23,000 severely damaged and 172,000 slightly damaged.

41
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:19,756
After visiting the destroyed German capital, British Air Force Marshal Arthur Tedder described it this way.

42
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:23,658
Berlin as a city is completely destroyed.

43
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:29,742
The ruins of what was once Berlin should be preserved as a modern Babylon or Carthage,

44
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:34,024
a monument to Prussian militarism and the horrors of the Nazi regime.

45
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,385
The city is completely dead.

46
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:42,329
You drive kilometer after kilometer through abandoned ruins and find nothing habitable.

47
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:44,810
Berlin can never be rebuilt.

48
00:04:53,688 --> 00:05:03,310
The New York Times in the summer of 1945 hopes that the obliteration of Berlin could herald the beginning of a renewed civilization of Germany,

49
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:13,253
and a visitor believes that very few people would regret the disappearance of this unlovable parvenu among European capitals.

50
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:21,435
The American journalist William Shirer describes Berlin in his diary.

51
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:31,252
How shall one find words to portray truthfully and accurately the picture of a great capital destroyed beyond recognition,

52
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:35,516
the image of a once powerful nation that has ceased to exist,

53
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:40,901
the image of a conquering people who only five years ago, when I left here,

54
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:47,727
behaved in such a brutally arrogant manner and were blindly convinced of their mission as a master race?

55
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:58,768
In this pile of rubble, there are also Berliners with confidence.

56
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:04,670
Journalist Ruth Andreas Friedrich writes in her diary on 7 July 1945,

57
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,551
The whole city lives in a frenzy of expectation.

58
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:12,212
One wants to tear oneself apart with eagerness to work,

59
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:15,373
to have a thousand hands and a thousand brains.

60
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:18,734
The Americans are here, the English, the Russians.

61
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:21,074
The French, too, are said to be in the offing.

62
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:24,715
Maybe they've already moved into their occupation area.

63
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:27,124
We don't know all that for sure.

64
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:30,426
Rumors abound, are defended and refuted.

65
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:32,146
It doesn't matter at all.

66
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:36,048
All that matters is that we are at the center of the activity.

67
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:39,609
2.8 million people live in Berlin.

68
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,391
Rubble women dominate the cityscape.

69
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:47,633
They take stone after stone out of the mountains of rubble for reconstruction.

70
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:50,394
Clean-up work that will take years.

71
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:53,775
And most of the men have been killed or imprisoned.

72
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,940
In Berlin at this time,

73
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,805
cameramen from Special Film Project 186 are also on the move.

74
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:05,883
On 9 July 1945,

75
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:13,987
Captain Carter shoots this footage of Berlin women and children, who are apparently being adequately cared for.

76
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,482
Refugees from the East, on the other hand,

77
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,563
have a particularly hard time.

78
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:29,925
US reporter William Shirer.

79
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:34,349
Starving human beings with no will, purpose in life or goal,

80
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,855
reduced to animalistic functions like finding food and shelter, to get through the next day of life.

81
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,103
Rations are meagre.

82
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:55,087
The best off are heavy workers and workers in unhealthy factories.

83
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,251
This also includes cultural and artistic workers.

84
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:03,274
Then come the categories for blue and white-collar workers,

85
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:05,196
rubble women and children.

86
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:14,363
Those who do not work only receive ration card number 5 for non-working family members and the rest of the population.

87
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:16,064
In the vernacular,

88
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:19,267
it is called the hunger or cemetery card.

89
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:26,218
Captain Carter's real job is to document the bomb damage in the capital.

90
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,360
On this 9th of July,

91
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,365
he's particularly interested in historic buildings that played a special role in the rise and fall of Adolf Hitler.

92
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:43,951
The Kaiserhof Hotel on Wilhelmsplatz was the first luxury hotel in Imperial Berlin.

93
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:49,755
In the 1920s, the operators sympathized with right-wing nationalist circles.

94
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,784
From 1932, Hitler lived exclusively in this hotel when he visited Berlin.

95
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:59,227
From his suite he planned the takeover of Germany.

96
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:08,334
On the 30th of January 1933 he travelled from here to President Hindenburg, who appointed him Reich Chancellor.

97
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:16,281
The Kaiserhof is just as much a ruin as the Berlin Sports Palace on Potsdamer Straße.

98
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,663
It was here that Hitler gave his first major speech.

99
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:23,704
as head of government in February 1933,

100
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:31,626
announcing the crushing of the Communist Party and declaring his anti-Semitic inflammatory slogans to be state doctrine.

101
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:38,727
Ten years later, on 18 February 1943, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels shouted,

102
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:40,467
Do you want total war?

103
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:41,527
Into the arena.

104
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:48,588
15,000 fanatical party comrades cheered him and chanted previously rehearsed slogans.

105
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:54,067
It took only two years for total war to finally reach Berlin.

106
00:09:54,828 --> 00:10:03,904
Hitler's Reich Chancellery was also badly damaged in a heavy bombing raid in February 1945. Soviet artillery did the rest.

107
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:16,932
On the 1st of May, Reich Chancellor Joseph Goebbels committed suicide here,

108
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:20,736
clearing the way for the unconditional surrender of the capital.

109
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:26,420
Red Army soldiers immortalized themselves on the sign with vulgar slogans.

110
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:32,405
The fate of Adolf Hitler remains unclear on this 9th of July 1945.

111
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:37,289
German propaganda had declared that the Führer was killed in action,

112
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,792
fighting for Germany against Bolshevism to his last breath.

113
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,646
But this is a bald-faced lie.

114
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:47,208
In the bunker under the garden of the Reich Chancellery,

115
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:51,250
the dictator shot himself in the head on 30 April.

116
00:10:54,953 --> 00:11:00,616
His last loyal followers carried the body to this bunker exit and doused it with petrol.

117
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:07,340
Former security officers will soon testify that they watched the burning from a watchtower.

118
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:18,553
They say that the charred remains of Hitler and his wife Eva were then buried in a bomb crater.

119
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:20,715
But what happened to the bodies?

120
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:27,461
As early as 5 May 1945, Soviet Secret Service agents found the grave.

121
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,082
Within a short time,

122
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,784
Hitler could be identified by his teeth.

123
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:34,407
Joseph Stalin was informed.

124
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:37,669
But the Kremlin ruler keeps the news to himself,

125
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,472
because he wants to keep his Western allies in the dark.

126
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:47,591
With heavy losses, the Red Army has captured Hitler's power center.

127
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,595
On this 9th of July 1945,

128
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:59,161
another US Air Force cameraman meticulously documents the bullet holes in Albert Speer's monumental architecture,

129
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:04,085
which for six years symbolized the German delusion of invincibility.

130
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:08,488
The Red Army put a bloody end to this hubris.

131
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,209
Throughout conquered Berlin,

132
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:20,190
the Soviet victors put up posters with mottos by Joseph Stalin.

133
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:27,412
The strength of the Red Army consists in the fact that it does not and cannot harbor racial hatred against other peoples,

134
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:29,533
not even against the German people,

135
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:33,894
as it is educated in the spirit of equality of all peoples and races,

136
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:37,375
in the spirit of respect for the rights of other peoples.

137
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:42,936
Such words are sheer mockery even for opponents of the Nazis.

138
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:47,276
in view of looting and countless rapes in the first weeks after the surrender.

139
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,119
Journalist Ruth Andreas Friedrich writes in her diary,

140
00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:00,367
How little do trained politicians understand the simple trick that you only win peoples if you offer them better than before.

141
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:07,093
The crowd hails the liberator, the savior from evil, because they added to their misery.

142
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:10,916
The inhabitants of the East Zone hate the Russians today.

143
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:13,734
The Americans will do it differently.

144
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:15,075
The English too.

145
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:22,922
They will correct the psychological blunders of the first occupying power and restore justice and trust."

146
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:34,732
A symbol of hope is the almost intact victory column, affectionately called the Gold-Else by Berliners.

147
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:42,222
It stands beyond the Brandenburg Gate in the British sector of Berlin, where the Union Jack has been flying since the 1st of July.

148
00:13:53,726 --> 00:14:04,328
Hollywood director George Stevens also took his camera crew to Wilhelmstrasse to visit Hitler's Reich Chancellery after the so-called Anschluss of Austria.

149
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:09,035
and the victory over France, the Germans cheered their Führer here.

150
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:12,677
Now most of them don't want to hear about it anymore.

151
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:18,620
These men are glad that they survived the war and were not taken to the Soviet Union.

152
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:30,547
George Stevens has special permission from the Soviet occupation authorities to also visit and film inside the building.

153
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:34,710
State guests were once received in the Cour d'honneur.

154
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:38,498
Albert Speer went all out for crude effects.

155
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:45,492
When the diplomats see this, they will learn to fear it, Hitler said to have once said to his architect.

156
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,321
The Hollywood director is also interested in the dictator's whereabouts.

157
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:57,762
That the body was burned here in the garden is only a rumor at this point.

158
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:03,184
What is certain is that Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda took their own lives here.

159
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:07,865
Their charred bodies were also recovered here by the Soviet Secret Service.

160
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:14,347
But in this case, Stalin's propaganda had already informed the world public about the find.

161
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:29,347
George Stevens drives with his team to the sites from the Germans' imperial past.

162
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:32,888
At the National Monument to Kaiser Wilhelm I,

163
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:37,189
the American reporters meet a group of Red Army soldiers.

164
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:47,752
The Soviets have already made a German prisoner of war flown in from Moscow, the police chief of Berlin. In May,

165
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:56,495
and, thanks to the anti-fascist attitude of Paul Markgraf, control the newly established police units.

166
00:15:57,296 --> 00:16:00,657
One of the tasks is to combat black market trafficking.

167
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:10,421
Directly at the Brandenburg Gate is the largest black market in occupied Berlin.

168
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,502
The place is ideal for illegal business,

169
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,823
because the Tiergarten is nearby.

170
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:19,496
and the Soviet sector begins only a few metres away.

171
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:25,758
Many Berliners sell their last belongings that survived the bombing war for food.

172
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,019
Officially,

173
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:34,321
the Allied authorities disapprove of the barter trade and occasionally try to crack down on it with raids.

174
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:41,223
The Western Allies are suspicious of the Markgraf police from the start,

175
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:51,487
rightly suspecting that the men are the extended arm of communist functionaries who have already arrived in Berlin from Soviet exile in early May.

176
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,809
The Communist Party of Germany, banned by the Nazis,

177
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:02,433
was already readmitted by the Soviets on 11 June 1945.

178
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,653
Most Berliners still don't care.

179
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:12,695
They're not interested in the slowly emerging conflict between the victorious powers, but in the daily struggle for survival.

180
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:23,129
On the 10th of July 1945,

181
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:33,955
Captain Carter of Special Film Project 186 shoots this scene of rubble women clearing mountains of rubble for 72 pfennig an hour and a better ration card.

182
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:46,521
Every brick that is still halfway usable will be the basis of new housing for Berlin's population,

183
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,303
which is overwhelmingly made up of women and children.

184
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:08,826
On this 10th of July 1945,

185
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:14,370
the journalist Ruth Andreas Friedrich reflects in her diary on the political future of Germany.

186
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:20,816
Perhaps part of our misfortune is due to the fact that we have too few personalities.

187
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:25,119
Each nation is naturally endowed with about the same percentage.

188
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,662
10% leaders against 90% led.

189
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:31,985
That is to say, among 60 million Germans,

190
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:39,388
about 6 million of all classes. who think independently, act independently, judge independently,

191
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,872
against 54 million who are indifferent,

192
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,074
immature and basically followers.

193
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:50,039
After the last 25 years, what has remained of this precious 10%?

194
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:11,759
Cameraman Carter's notes say that this boy's parents are dead and the nine-year-old is searching for his big brother.

195
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,285
Endless refugee tracks pass through the ruined city.

196
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:26,308
Hundreds of thousands of people who have come from the east with their few possessions.

197
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,470
Because Berlin is already overcrowded,

198
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:31,411
most of them have to move on.

199
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:41,537
Those who live in Berlin have to improvise every day.

200
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,849
Water is a precious commodity.

201
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:51,178
The supply is still provided by public pumps,

202
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,521
but some of the groundwater is contaminated and carries the risk of contracting dysentery or typhus.

203
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:13,245
Even the obviously better off show up in the streets and stroll through Berlin in pretty summer dresses, looking for work, barter goods or a flat.

204
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:25,148
Many of the undestroyed houses and villas in the suburbs of Dahlem, Zehlendorf or Charlottenburg have been requisitioned by the British and Americans to house the occupying troops.

205
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:33,977
Ruth Andreas Friedrich writes in her diary,

206
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:38,941
Our soldiers have also seized quarters in Russia and France.

207
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,874
Only that one obviously feels something like this much more bitterly when it happens to oneself.

208
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:48,597
Evacuation within a few hours.

209
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:52,600
Barely the most necessary things allowed to be taken away.

210
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:56,724
When the flat door clicks shut behind the evacuees,

211
00:20:57,345 --> 00:21:00,247
they can consider themselves totally bombed out.

212
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:03,270
And as with the totally bombed out,

213
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,993
the unfortunates fall without distinction of person.

214
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:10,103
Whether Nazi opponent or Nazi friend,

215
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:11,284
rich or poor,

216
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,006
whoever has to get out has to get out.

217
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,769
Let him then see where he can find a place to live.

218
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,894
Those who were bombed out during the last years of the war know this situation.

219
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:30,818
On the ruins you can still see the inscriptions with new addresses for relatives or friends.

220
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:35,701
Many flats have bomb damage but are still usable.

221
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:37,974
If the facade is missing,

222
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:40,576
family life takes place in front of the public.

223
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:44,878
At night, people have to be careful not to fall in the dark.

224
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:49,621
Entire streets, on the other hand, are uninhabitable.

225
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:52,402
On this 10th of July 1945,

226
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:56,084
Captain Carter shoots a tracking shot for the US Air Force.

227
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:59,927
The green of the street trees will not remain for long.

228
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:04,989
Most of them are already cut down in autumn, as fuel for the winter.

229
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,981
Although most of the streets have been cleared,

230
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:21,024
there is almost no traffic in the former metropolis.

231
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:24,246
Only a few private vehicles are registered.

232
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:29,931
Most of the wide cars were confiscated by the Wehrmacht or later by the victors,

233
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:34,795
and so people wait patiently for the few means of public transport,

234
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,578
like here at Alexanderplatz in the Soviet sector,

235
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:43,081
where there are regular tram connections to the outer districts again.

236
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:58,961
Even an S-Bahn line has been back in service since the beginning of July.

237
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:12,391
George Stevens has gone to the Reichssportfeld, where Nazi Germany was allowed to host the 1936 Summer Olympics.

238
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:15,833
At first, the USA wanted to boycott the event.

239
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,796
But when the regime agreed to allow Jewish athletes to compete,

240
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:21,937
American officials relented.

241
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:28,202
Jesse Owens, a black athlete with four gold medals, became the superstar of the games,

242
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:32,065
much to the chagrin of the Führer.

243
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:37,790
Not only in the USA, but also in Germany,

244
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,315
many people had hoped that the Olympic Games would strengthen the dictator's will for peace,

245
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:46,337
but this soon proved to be a naive illusion.

246
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:54,030
The site has been in the British sector since the arrival of the Western Allies.

247
00:23:54,571 --> 00:24:00,157
The new masters immediately put the Olympic swimming stadium back into operation for their soldiers.

248
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:03,681
For Germans, of course, swimming is off-limits.

249
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:29,228
George Stevens and his team also take a trip to the Wannsee, where only a few bathers are enjoying themselves in July 1945.

250
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:45,839
They are occupation soldiers and their female companions, who demonstratively ignore the ban on fraternization.

251
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,743
The relationship between the soldiers of the victorious powers still seems to be unclouded here.

252
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:04,766
The interest in the German foil lines unites them.

253
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:19,255
Germans are not allowed to enter the beach, but they're only too happy to make an exception for attractive young ladies.

254
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,823
There is even a golf course at the beach club of the 2nd US Armoured Division,

255
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,364
"the Hell on Wheels".

256
00:25:33,585 --> 00:25:36,187
Under the command of General George S. Patton,

257
00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:44,594
the unit has fought its way from Normandy through the Ardennes to Germany and is now stationed in the American sector of Berlin.

258
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:51,179
German policemen have cleared the square at the Brandenburg Gate for a large parade by the British.

259
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,043
The men are wearing uniforms that were in service before 1933.

260
00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:58,765
Especially in the Soviet sector,

261
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:01,647
the police are not too particular about their past.

262
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:06,990
Men trained under the Nazis are also loyally at the service of the new masters.

263
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:14,095
On this 12th of July 1945,

264
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:20,739
soldiers of the British Desert Rats march across Hitler's east-west axis to the Brandenburg Gate.

265
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,663
The cameramen of Special Film Project 186 are on site to film the special spectacle.

266
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:33,556
The 7th British Armoured Division distinguished itself above all in the battles of the African Campaign,

267
00:26:34,117 --> 00:26:36,959
liberating Tripoli and Tunis in 1943.

268
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,283
It crossed the Rhine in March 1945 and took part in the occupation of Hamburg.

269
00:26:49,768 --> 00:26:53,711
The border between the British and Soviet sectors runs right here.

270
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:59,175
So this square is the ideal place to celebrate the joint victory over Nazi Germany.

271
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:20,809
But Berliners sense very clearly that cracks are appearing in the Allied Brotherhood in arms.

272
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,220
Journalist Ruth Andreas Friedrich writes in her diary,

273
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:30,125
They don't seem to love each other, our Allied occupying forces.

274
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:32,627
One must not let this become loud.

275
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:43,055
If we cautiously hint to the Americans and English that there might have been difficulties with the Russian occupation, their countenances turn cold as ice.

276
00:27:48,596 --> 00:27:50,656
Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery,

277
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:53,857
the Commander-in-Chief of the British Occupation Forces,

278
00:27:54,177 --> 00:28:01,420
has arrived from his headquarters in East Westphalia to present the victor of Berlin with a high British order of merit,

279
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,361
Marshal Georgy Zhukov.

280
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:12,623
Joint appearances like this are intended to deceive the public about the true state of relations between the Allies.

281
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:41,794
Hollywood director George Stevens has also come to Berlin with his team to document the forthcoming Conference of the Victors.

282
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:46,137
Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin had last met in Yalta.

283
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,423
After the death of the US president, Harry S. Truman has become his successor.

284
00:28:55,304 --> 00:28:59,707
The big three are meeting in Potsdam to discuss the future of Germany.

285
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:06,409
Although Truman sees with concern that the Red Army controls almost all of Eastern Europe,

286
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:12,171
he still believes in a future for the anti-Hitler coalition with the Soviet Union.

287
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:18,013
In the British sector, George Stevens films a Red Army unit marching through the Tiergarten.

288
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:24,155
His president expresses the belief these days that the Russians would continue to be friends of the US.

289
00:29:34,932 --> 00:29:39,960
Although incidents between GIs and Red Army soldiers continue to occur in Berlin,

290
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,949
Truman sees no reason at this point not to welcome their friendship and give them ours.

291
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:13,502
July 14, 1945. Captain Carter of Special Film Project 186 shoots this footage at Pariser Platz,

292
00:30:13,922 --> 00:30:15,863
which is part of the Soviet sector.

293
00:30:20,205 --> 00:30:24,607
What will be the future of a destroyed, defeated and occupied Germany?

294
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:30,089
Will the Soviet Union sooner or later extend its influence further west?

295
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:35,619
Is Joseph Stalin counting on the withdrawal of American troops from Europe,

296
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,201
as Roosevelt had announced at Yalta?

297
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:53,437
Or will the British, Americans and French stick to their plan to rebuild the country and educate the Germans to become Democrats?

298
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:10,291
After all, the President never really took seriously US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau's idea of making Germany an agricultural country without heavy industry.

299
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:16,133
Morgenthau's adversary, US Secretary of War Henry Stimson,

300
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:25,257
won Truman over with the view that the only hope for a stable future in Europe was an economically strong and productive Germany.

301
00:31:25,998 --> 00:31:31,441
In his diary he writes about a conversation with Truman in mid-May 1945.

302
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:35,383
Punish the war criminals severely.

303
00:31:35,923 --> 00:31:37,864
Take away the weapons for all time.

304
00:31:38,645 --> 00:31:44,168
Supervise government action until the Nazi educated generation has left the stage.

305
00:31:44,788 --> 00:31:49,971
But don't deprive them of the possibility of building a contented Germany at the end,

306
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:54,633
interested only in the non-military methods of civilization.

307
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:04,343
This is exactly what Ruth Andreas Friedrich hopes for.

308
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:15,209
That four world powers will meet in our ruins, and that we will prove to the representatives of these world powers how serious we are about our zeal,

309
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,952
how boundlessly serious about the effort to make amends and rise.

310
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,834
Berlin is running at full speed.

311
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:25,956
If we are understood and forgiven now,

312
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,177
everything will be achieved from us.

313
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:33,759
Everything. That we renounce Nazism, that we find the new better,

314
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,999
that we work and are fundamentally of goodwill.

315
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,801
Never before have we been so ripe for redemption,

316
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:46,522
so tired of terror, fear and injustice.

317
00:32:47,122 --> 00:32:50,423
If only our victors will keep their promises to us.

318
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:57,985
Tempelhof Airport was one of the first major projects of the Third Reich.

319
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:00,906
When it was inaugurated in 1941,

320
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:05,809
the monumental facility was considered the largest surface building in the world.

321
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:13,552
However, when the US Air Force took over the site on the 2nd of July 1945, the cleanup work was not complete.

322
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:25,617
So on the afternoon of the 15th of July 1945, three C-54 transport planes land at the British military airfield in Gatow.

323
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:36,591
On board they have the American delegation that the US President is taking to the Potsdam Conference.

324
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:41,933
It is four times the size of the delegation that had traveled to Yalta in February.

325
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:49,435
The notorious prosecutor of the Stalinist show trials

326
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:56,897
Andrei Vyshinsky and Soviet Ambassador Andrei Gromyko greet US Secretary of State James Burns.

327
00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:06,637
Various generals and liaison officers accompany the president,

328
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:09,580
plus Secret Service security guards,

329
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,242
naval cooks and military doctors,

330
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:14,624
to ensure Truman's well-being.

331
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:28,376
U.S. General George Marshall is one of the advocates of rapid reconstruction with American help.

332
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:35,544
He will initiate the Marshall Plan for Europe, named after him, in 1948.

333
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,912
Then Truman also leaves his plane.

334
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:45,258
In a letter to his mother and sister before leaving Washington,

335
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:46,499
he had written,

336
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:54,078
I have a briefcase full of information about previous conferences and suggestions as to what I should do and say.

337
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:56,200
I wish I didn't have to go there.

338
00:34:59,763 --> 00:35:03,927
Potsdam has been sealed off by Soviet checkpoints for days.

339
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:13,188
In front of the villa of a German publisher in Babelsberg, called Little White House,

340
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:20,215
President Truman receives the British Prime Minister on the morning of 16 July 1945.

341
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:23,818
These scenes are filmed by Kirk B. Lawton,

342
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:26,240
who is part of the American delegation.

343
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:34,027
Winston Churchill is a head of government on call because he lost the House of Commons elections on 5 July.

344
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,722
He believes Truman cannot hold a candle to his late predecessor,

345
00:35:39,242 --> 00:35:43,765
but he's impressed from the outset by the president's tremendous resolve.

346
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:49,388
Truman is apparently less enthusiastic, as his diary reveals.

347
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:54,231
He taught me a lot of nonsense about how great my country was,

348
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:56,072
how much he loved Roosevelt,

349
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:57,633
and how he would love me.

350
00:35:58,493 --> 00:36:01,955
I think we can get along if he doesn't butter me up too much.

351
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:09,409
George Stevens drives with his team along the Autobahn to Potsdam.

352
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:15,470
On the way, he films Berliners who have apparently procured food in the surrounding countryside.

353
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,991
In her diary, Ruth Andreas Friedrich hopes for positive news.

354
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:27,854
It was announced on the radio this evening that Stalin, Truman and Churchill had arrived for a joint conference.

355
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:30,194
What has happened up to now,

356
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:33,215
we have to accept as the aftermath of war,

357
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:36,997
including the rapes, the looting and confiscations.

358
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:40,599
The meeting of the big three will establish order.

359
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,841
It will prepare the ground for good to flourish.

360
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:56,068
George Stevens' camera crew is filming in the old garrison city of the Prussian kings,

361
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,750
now in the Soviet occupation zone.

362
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,571
Stalin has refused to enter Berlin.

363
00:37:04,888 --> 00:37:11,389
Graves of Soviet soldiers testify to the fact that Potsdam was not vacated by the Wehrmacht without a fight.

364
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:17,231
Because of the stage guests, the Red Army marches through the city more frequently.

365
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:19,412
This brings back bad memories,

366
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:20,972
especially for many women.

367
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:26,434
A Potsdam woman later writes about the 8th of May 1945,

368
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:28,854
How we had longed for this end,

369
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:32,375
but had we now reached a state we could call peace?

370
00:37:33,108 --> 00:37:38,052
We had not imagined the Soviet occupation to be as bad as it now appeared.

371
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:45,058
Now what we had sometimes said in jest during the last months of the war had become reality.

372
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:48,541
Enjoy the war. Peace will be terrible.

373
00:37:54,847 --> 00:38:00,111
Although Potsdam was badly hit in an American bombing raid in the spring of 1945,

374
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:01,708
In Stalin's eyes,

375
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:04,050
it was suitable for the big conference.

376
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:09,273
It is in Soviet-occupied territory and can be better protected than Berlin.

377
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:15,377
The magnificent buildings from the Prussian era,

378
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,059
such as the Nikolaikirche by Karl Friedrich Schinkel,

379
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,540
are also damaged.

380
00:38:22,321 --> 00:38:26,743
The decision of the upcoming conference will shape the lives of Germans for decades.

381
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:41,874
Media representatives from all over Europe have arrived to cover the major event.

382
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,121
Steven's team proudly presents the Russian pass for the car.

383
00:38:55,861 --> 00:38:59,463
The Hollywood director has an accreditation for the big event.

384
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:04,043
Whether he was finally allowed to shoot there in black and white is unclear,

385
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:10,889
so these scenes remain George Stevens' last colour shots before his return to America.

386
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,368
The 17th of July 1945.

387
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:24,719
Before the start of the conference, Stalin pays his respects to the American president.

388
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:28,383
Kirk B. Lawton shoots with his amateur camera.

389
00:39:32,512 --> 00:39:36,815
Truman will later describe the most powerful man in the world as friendly,

390
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,077
good-natured and businesslike,

391
00:39:39,938 --> 00:39:42,299
as honest and insanely smart.

392
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,260
At the meeting,

393
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,863
US Secretary of State Burns casually asks the Soviet dictator if he knows anything about Hitler's whereabouts.

394
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:58,205
Stalin claims Hitler is still alive and hiding in Spain or Argentina.

395
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:05,628
The venue for the Potsdam Conference is Cecilienhof Palace,

396
00:40:06,088 --> 00:40:10,776
where the German Crown Prince and his family resided before 1918.

397
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:13,830
Lawton is allowed to film from the gallery.

398
00:40:14,468 --> 00:40:16,508
A Russian camera crew, on the other hand,

399
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:19,129
shoots in 35mm colour.

400
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,751
Officially, the Soviet Union is still neutral towards Japan,

401
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:30,472
and so the first topic at the negotiating table is the Pacific War.

402
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:37,954
Stalin has already signalled to Truman during the morning conversation that he will soon declare war on Japan.

403
00:40:38,694 --> 00:40:44,175
Then Stalin, Truman and Churchill discuss the drawing of borders in post-war Europe.

404
00:40:44,796 --> 00:40:48,997
reparation payments and the administration of occupied Germany.

405
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:56,859
Press meeting of the big three on the terrace.

406
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:06,722
Truman is in high spirits because he has got his hands on a military instrument with threatening potential just in time for the start of the conference.

407
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,662
On a military base in New Mexico,

408
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:13,643
the first nuclear weapons test in history has succeeded.

409
00:41:14,276 --> 00:41:18,218
A new era has begun that will soon be called the Cold War.

410
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:30,147
Special Film Project 186 finishes its month-long work in Germany with aerial footage of destroyed Berlin.

411
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:33,169
About 80 hours of footage have been shot.

412
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:38,953
The unique material will disappear for decades in a U.S. Air Force depot.

413
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:42,475
There is no money to edit a documentary film from it.

414
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,001
In Potsdam, the victors agree that Germany will not be partitioned.

415
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:04,404
The West accepts Stalin's demand for the separation of East Prussia and the areas east of the Oder and Neisse rivers.

416
00:42:04,944 --> 00:42:09,126
The country is to be completely disarmed and demilitarized.

417
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:11,907
The Germans must pay reparations.

418
00:42:12,968 --> 00:42:17,089
War criminals are to be trialed by an international military tribunal.

419
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:22,031
Ruth Andreas Friedrich is optimistic.

420
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,821
Big headlines in the newspapers.

421
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:26,702
The Potsdam Agreement.

422
00:42:27,062 --> 00:42:29,804
Common policy in all occupation zones.

423
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:32,445
Agreement on the peace order in Europe.

424
00:42:33,086 --> 00:42:36,228
It took a load off our minds, so no new war.

425
00:42:37,128 --> 00:42:39,170
Common construction and common order.

426
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,731
The final communique emphasises

427
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:48,535
The statesmen leave the conference with the renewed confidence that the governments and peoples of their countries

428
00:42:48,996 --> 00:42:51,699
in conjunction with the other United Nations,

429
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:55,804
will ensure the establishment of a just and lasting peace.

430
00:42:56,585 --> 00:42:58,907
It sounds almost too good to be true.

431
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:29,045
The American president is not quite so confident.

432
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:31,887
At the site of the destruction in Berlin,

433
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:33,928
Truman was utterly shocked.

434
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:37,471
On 16 July 1945,

435
00:43:37,771 --> 00:43:39,212
he wrote in his diary,

436
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:42,193
I thought of Carthage, Baalbek,

437
00:43:42,614 --> 00:43:45,115
Jerusalem, Rome, Atlantis,

438
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:46,736
thought of Scipio,

439
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:49,218
Ramses II and Genghis Khan.

440
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:52,239
I hope for some kind of peace.

441
00:43:52,856 --> 00:43:56,959
but fear that machines are several centuries ahead of morality.

442
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,863
Only when morality has caught up will there be no more need for such destruction.
